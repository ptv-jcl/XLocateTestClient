----------------------------------------------
This sample is intended to offer a very simple user interface to get experienced 
with the parameters of geocoding and reverse geocoding provided by the xlocate server.
Please be aware that the sample deals with several restrictions, i.e. the handling
of the parameters is much more flexible than the sample application.

Notes
- If the checkbox "SearchOptions" is disabled, the forward geocoding doesn't 
  provide explicit search options within the xml request.
- The parameter MAX_RESULT is only evaluated if the text box is not empty.
  ==> there is either no search option specified or 14/15.
- If the checkbox "ReverseSearchOptions" is disabled, the reverse geocoding 
  doesn't provide explicit reverse search options within the xml request.
  ==> there is either no reverse search option specified or 4 of them!
- you can onfigure default values for some   

2008-08-05: BWE
- SearchOption "MAX_RESULT" added, 
- Most UI elements can be configured via "Settings.settings"
- if WKT is requested, the output grid displays the WKT!
